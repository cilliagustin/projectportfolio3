# Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver is an interactive application run through the Heroku terminal. Using this, the user is able to get the solution to any sudoku puzzle.

Although Sudoku is a game mainly played by adults, anyone can run this program in order to get the solution or just check if they correctly completed the puzzle.

The app can be intuitively run. From the main menu the user can either go to the information menu, here they will find out more about how to run the app and also about the history and rules of the sudoku. From the main menu they can also go to the screen where they can fill the puzzle with all the given numbers and get the solution.

## UX
The app runs in the Heroku terminal and consists of three menus:
* Main menu: The landing page and where the user can go to the other two menus.
* Information menu: Here the user can either get more information on the game (history and rules of the sudoku) or get more information on the app (How to enter a puzzle and get the correct solution).
* Solving menu: This is where the user enters the puzzle and gets the solution.

Although running the app on a terminal has certain limitations regarding the user experience, colors (imported via colorama), titles created with ascii code, and effects were used to engage the user and catch their attention.

### Colour Scheme and Typography
The colorama module was imported in order to be able to add colors to the app. These are used throughout the different parts of the website to enphasyse different things.
In the information menu, the color blue was used throughout the "App explanation" to emphasize how the numbers must be formatted in order to be accepted as valid.
When printing the puzzle with the style board function (more information about all functions will be given later on), the color red is used to express an unknown number in the puzzle (a zero), green is used for all the given (known) numbers, and cyan is used to show all the guide numbers on the top and the right side of the puzzle (used to orient the user to where the numbers should be entered).
In the app, many inputs are printed where they ask the user to enter a specific command. In these cases, the blue color is often used to highlight which commands are valid.
If the user enters an invalid command, the wrong input function will be triggered. This will display an error message using the colors red and yellow to indicate the invalid input.

The only customisation used for the typography in the app were the titles created with ascii code. The titles "Sudoku Solver", "Information", "The Game" and "The App" were created to attract the attention of the user when going through a specific part of the app.
